                <h1>About Inkquery:</h1>
                <p class="lead">Inkquery is a web-based app that utilizes machine leanring to make the process of finding a tattoo artist more efficient. Currently, when someone wants to find a new tattoo artist, they often turn to aggregated shop reviews through a service like Yelp. While this can be helpful, it often requires a large time commitment, and such reviews often lack any artist-specific content. This is where Inkquery comes in. Inkquery pulls data from local artists and uses a support vector machine image classifier to determine if the post contains a tattoo. If it does, it's then displayed on the web app, where posts are sorted by popularity. I started Inkquery by focusing on artisits within my city of Chicago, and I have plans to expand the project to cover additional cities.</p>
                <h1>FAQs:</h1>
                <h2>why are some posts from non-Chicago based artists?:</h2>
                <p class="lead">This is a artifact from the way I assembled my master list of artists within Chicago. I was surprised to find that lists of Instagram artisits within given cities don't exist online, so I had to get creative. I began by web scraping Yelp for tattoo shop Instagram accounts from the 30 most popular shops in Chicago. From these accounts, I then scraped the 50 most recent posts from each, and pulled the text data from each post as this text is often attributing work for a specific tattoo to the artist. I then searched within this text for Instagram account names, and added them to my master list. Occasionally, posts from Chicago tattoo shops would mention other artists/accounts that were not Chicago-based, and they found their way onto my master list. Thankfully, I built my data pipeline to handle this, and there's a 'human-in-the-loop' element: whenever I find accounts that don't belong on Inkquery, I'm able to add them to a list of accounts to exclude. As time goes on, these accounts are removed from the site, and Inkquery continues to improve.</p>
                <h2>why didn't you use a neural net/deep learning?:</h2>
                <p class="lead">Time and resources. I would have loved to continue to improve and refine the machine learning aspect of Inkquery, but the timeline for Insight is very tight (Inkquery was built in ~2 weeks). Building out the data pipeline backend was challenging, and I didn't have time to assemble the amount of (labeled) training data I anticipated needing to properly utilize a neural net to get a more accurate classifier. As it stands, my SVM classifier is performing at 70% accuracy, and I feel like it's doing a really great job at filtering out irrelevant content when compared to more limited Instagram searches alone.</p>
                <h2>do you have any plans going forward?:</h2>
                <p class="lead">Yes! I'm super happy with how Inkquery worked out, but I'm already looking ahead to V.2. Things I would love to work on going forward:</p>
                <p class="lead">- more cities: my data pipeline is built in a way that it would be relatively straightforward for me to add additional cities, so that users can search for artists in cities other than Chicago</p>
                <p class="lead">- improve artist list curation: as described above, I came up with a solution to the nonexistance of lists of artists on Instagram broken down by city. However, it's not perfect. I'd like to build a better system that incorporates network analysis to better verify whether a given artist works within the city. The idea being that an artist working within a city is followed by and follows more artists within their own city compared to other locations. I believe incorporating this step would make Inkquery less reliant on the 'human-in-the-loop' aspect discussed above.</p>
                <p class="lead">- better classification: I would eventually like to implement a deep learning/neural net classifier that more accurately determines whether a given post contains a tattoo or not. In addition to simple binary classification, I'd eventually like to classify the type of tattoo (American Traditional, geometric, text, etc.) to improve Inkquery even further and help end users find their perfect artist.</p>
