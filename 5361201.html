  Real estate appraisal using predictive modeling


      Abstract
      translated from

An automated real estate appraisal system (100) and method generates
estimates of real estate value using a predictive model such as a neural
network (908). The predictive model (908) generates these estimates
based on learned relationships among variables describing individual
property characteristics (905) as well as general neighborhood
characteristics at various levels of geographic specificity (906). The
system (100) may also output reason codes indicating relative
contributions (1009) of various variables to a particular result, and
may generate reports (701) describing property valuations, market trend
analyses, property conformity information, and recommendations regarding
loans based on risk related to a property.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field Invention

This invention relates generally to real estate appraisals and sales
price predictions. In particular, the invention relates to an automated
real estate appraisal system and method that uses predictive modeling to
perform pattern recognition and classification in order to provide
accurate sales price predictions.

2. Description of Related Art

The "appraised value" of a real estate parcel, or property, comprises
some estimate of the full market value of the property on a specified
date. A property's appraised value is of great importance in many types
of real estate transactions, including sales and loans.

Conventionally, appraised value is determined by a professional
appraiser using both objective and subjective factors. One disadvantage
of such a method is the difficulty in ensuring that the appraiser
conducts a neutral, unbiased analysis in arriving at the appraised
value. This difficulty is often compounded by the fact that the
appraiser may be retained and paid by an interested party in the
contemplated transaction, such as a lender, mortgage broker, buyer, or
seller.

In order to reduce bias and provide more accurate appraisals,
statistical techniques may be used to obtain an independent, consistent,
mathematically derived estimate of a property's value to assist an
appraiser in generating an appraised value. Traditional statistical
techniques, such as multiple linear regression and logistic regression,
have been tried, but such techniques typically suffer from a number of
deficiencies. One deficiency is the inability of traditional regression
models to capture complex behavior in predictor variables resulting from
nonlinearities and interactions among predictor variables. In addition,
traditional regression models do not adapt well to changing trends in
the data, so that automated model redevelopment is difficult to implement.

One example of the difficulty of applying a regression model to
appraisal problems is the uncertainty as to the optimal temporal and
geographical sample size for model development. A model developed using
all homes in one square city block might theoretically be an effective
predictor for that particular neighborhood, but it may not be possible
to develop such a model with sufficient stability and reliability, due
to the relatively small sample size. On the other hand, a model
developed using all homes sold in the United States in the past month
might have a sufficiently large sample size, but might be unable to
capture local, neighborhood characteristics to provide an accurate
appraisal. Thus, a significant deficiency of traditional regression
modeling techniques when applied to real estate appraisals is the
inability to successfully model neighborhood characteristics while
including a sufficiently large sample size to develop a robust, stable
statistical model.

It is desirable, therefore, to have an automated system that uses
available information regarding real estate properties to provide
accurate estimates of value. Preferably, such a system should be
flexible enough to allow model development in a relatively small
geographic area, it should be able to handle nonlinearities and
interactions among predictor variables without advance specification, it
should have high predictive accuracy, and it should have capability for
redevelopment of the underlying system model as new patterns of real
estate pricing emerge.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an automated
system (100) and method for real estate appraisals, which uses one or
more predictive models such as neural networks (908) to generate
estimates of real estate value. The predictive models (908) generate
these estimates based on learned relationships among variables
describing individual property characteristics (905). The models (908)
also learn relationships between individual property characteristics
(905) and area characteristics (906). Area characteristics (906) are
stored and applied at a level of geographic specificity that varies
according to the amount of data available at each of several
successively larger geographic areas. In this way the models (908) are
able to capture local neighborhood characteristics without unduly
reducing sample sizes, which would reduce reliability and predictability.

The learned relationships among individual property characteristics
(905) and area characteristics (906) enable the system (100) to estimate
the value of the property being appraised. Error models (909) may also
be provided to generate an estimated value range or error interval for
the sales price. The appraised value and error estimate may then be
provided as output (907) to a human decision-maker, along with other
related information such as: reason codes that reveal the relative
contributions of various factors to the appraised value; and various
measures of market trends. Finally, the system (100) periodically
monitors its performance, and redevelops the models (908,909) when
performance drops below a predetermined level.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

The Figures depict preferred embodiments of the present invention for
purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily
recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of
the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without
departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a block diagram of a typical
implementation of a system 100 in accordance with the present invention.
The user supplies property data to system 100 via input device 105.
Central processing unit (CPU) 101 runs software program instructions,
stored in program storage 107, which direct CPU 101 to perform the
various functions of system 100. In the embodiment illustrated herein,
the software program is written in the Microsoft Excel macro language
and the ANSI C language. Each of these languages may be run on a variety
of conventional hardware platforms. Data storage 103 contains data
describing real estate properties, as well as regional data. It also
contains model parameters. In accordance with the software program
instructions, CPU 101 accepts input from input device 105, accesses data
storage 103, and uses RAM 102 in a conventional manner as a workspace.
CPU 101, data storage 103, and program storage 107 operate together to
provide predictive neural network models 908 for real estate appraisal,
as well as error models 909 for generating error ranges for the
appraised values. If desired, multiple models 908 and 909 may be used
(for example, one for each geographic region), particularly when
property pricing characteristics vary widely from region to region.
After neural network models 908 and error models 909 process the
information, as described below, to obtain estimates of property value
and error range, a signal indicative of the estimate and error range is
sent from CPU 101 to output device 104.

In the embodiment illustrated herein, CPU 101 can be a mainframe
computer or a powerful personal computer; RAM 102 and data storage 103
are conventional RAM, ROM and disk storage devices for the CPU; and
output device 104 is a conventional means for either printing results
based on the signals generated by neural network models 908 and error
models 909, displaying the results on a video screen using a
window-based interface system, or sending the results to a database for
later access.

Referring now also to FIGS. 2 through 7, there are shown sample screens
from a conventional window-based interface system (not shown) that forms
part of output device 104. FIG. 2 shows data entry form 201 that allows
the user to enter data describing a property for appraisal. Form 201 is
also known as a Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (URAR) form. It
contains a number of data fields 202. Scroll bars 203 are provided to
allow navigation throughout form 201.

FIG. 3 shows quick data entry form 301 that allows quick entry of
property data without using a complete URAR form 201. This form is
intended for use when a quick estimate of property value is required. A
number of fields 302 are provided, which represent a subset of the
fields 202 in URAR form 201. Data entered on URAR form 201 for a
particular property is automatically transferred to quick form 301, and
vice versa.

FIG. 4 shows record selection screen 401 that allows the user to select
among previously-entered property records in order to view URAR form 201
for the selected record. Record selection screen 401 lists a plurality
of records 402, showing the address 403, city 404, map reference 405,
sale price 406, assessor parcel number (APN) group 407, ZIP code 408,
and sale date 409 for each record. Scroll bars 410 are provided to allow
navigation throughout the list of records, and selected records are
indicated by highlighting 411.

FIG. 5 shows sales price estimate screen 501 that provides appraisal
information. Estimated sales price 502 is shown, along with lowest
typical sales price 503 and highest typical sales price 504. Also shown
are positive contribution factors 505 that tend to drive the price of
the property up, and negative contribution factors 506 that tend to
drive the price of the property down.

FIG. 6 shows area averages screen 601 that shows average values 602 for
several property criteria 603 for a selected geographic area, alongside
comparative values for a selected property 605. Clicking arrow buttons
606 changes the level of geographic specificity, according to the
following sequence: neighborhood, local, extended, region, and county.
The example shows neighborhood values, representing the average values
for all properties sold in the same neighborhood as the selected
property, over a period of time prior to the selected sale.

Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown statistical review report 701
summarizing property information and estimated value, and providing
recommendations regarding loan processing with respect to the property.
This type of report would typically be used when system 100 of the
present invention is employed to appraise properties in connection with
loan processing. Identification portion 702 identifies the loan,
property, and appraisal to which report 701 pertains. Explanatory
portion 703 gives general explanatory information concerning the report.
Regional trend analysis portion 704 reports average sales prices for the
county and ZIP code in the four preceding semiannual periods, indicating
market stability and providing a broad foundation for valuation and risk
analysis. Local trend analysis portion 705 reports average sales prices
for smaller geographic areas, such as the census tract, map grid, and
assessor parcel number (APN) group, in the four preceding semiannual
periods, indicating local market stability and providing a further
information useful for valuation and risk analysis. Subject conformity
portion 706 compares sales price, square footage, and price per square
foot for the property with the norms for the neighborhood. Subject
valuation portion 707 provides a value range for the property based on
the characteristics of the property and the region, and compares the
value range with an appraisal value determined by an independent human
appraiser. Subject valuation portion 707 also provides an indication of
the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the loan, and a comparison with a
user-supplied maximum LTV ratio. Summary and recommendations portion 708
summarizes the information given in the other portions and recommends
one of "Proceed", "Caution", or "Suspend".

Referring now to FIG. 8, there is shown an overall flowchart
illustrating the major functions and operation of system 100. First
neural network models 908 are trained 801 using training data describing
a number of individual real estate properties, characteristics, and
prices, as well as area characteristics. If real estate pricing
characteristics vary widely from region to region, it may be
advantageous to use different models 908 for the different regions
(counties, for example). Once neural network models 908 are trained,
neural network model parameters are stored 802. Error models 909, which
are typically regression models, are then trained 803 using additional
training data and output from neural network models 908. Once error
models 909 are trained, error model parameters are stored 804, and
system 100 is able to estimate prices and pricing errors for a subject
property. System 100 obtains 805 property data describing the subject
property 905, as well as data describing the area in which the subject
property is situated 906. System 100 then applies 806 property data 905
and area data 906 to the appropriate stored neural network model 908. It
then applies 807 property data 905 and area data 906 to the appropriate
stored error model 909. The models 908 and 909 estimate sales price,
reason codes (described below), and estimated error, which are output
805 to the user, or to a database, or to another system via output
device 104.

Referring now to FIG. 9, the overall functional architecture of system
100 is shown. System 100 is broken down into two major components: model
development component 901 and property valuation component 902. Model
development component 901 uses training data 904 describing a number of
real estate properties, characteristics, and prices to build neural
network models 908 containing information representing learned
relationships among a number of variables. Together, the learned
relationships form models 908 of the behavior of the variables. Although
neural network models 908 are used in the embodiment illustrated herein,
any type of predictive modeling technique may be used, such as
regression modeling. For purposes of illustration, the invention is
described here in terms of neural network statistical models 908. Model
development component 901 also uses training data 904 to develop error
models 909, which are typically regression models used to estimate error
in predicted sales prices generated by neural network models 908.

Property valuation component 902 feeds input data describing the subject
property 905 and its geographic area 906 to neural network models 908
and error models 909. It obtains results from models 908 and 909 and
generates price estimates, error ranges, and reason codes. A report is
prepared using this information, and the report is output 907 either to
a screen display, printer, or stored in a database for future access.

Each of the two components 901 and 902 of system 100 will be described
in turn.

Model Development Component 901

Neural networks employ a technique of "learning" relationships through
repeated exposure to data and adjustment of internal weights. They allow
rapid model development and automated data analysis. Essentially, such
networks represent a statistical modeling technique that is capable of
building models 908 from data containing both linear and non-linear
relationships. While similar in concept to regression analysis, neural
networks are able to capture nonlinearity and interactions among
independent variables without pre-specification. In other words, while
traditional regression analysis requires that nonlinearities and
interactions be detected and specified manually, neural networks perform
these tasks automatically. For a more detailed description of neural
networks, see D. E. Rumelhart et al, "Learning Representations by
Back-Propagating Errors", Nature v. 323, pp. 533-36 (1986), and R.
Hecht-Nielsen, "Theory of the Backpropagation Neural Network", in Neural
Networks for Perception, pp. 65-93 (1992), the teachings of which are
incorporated herein by reference.

Neural networks comprise a number of interconnected neuron-like
processing elements that send data to each other along connections. The
strengths of the connections among the processing elements are
represented by weights. Referring now to FIG. 20, there is shown a
diagram of a single processing element 2001. The processing element
receives inputs X_1 , X_2 , . . . X_n , either from other processing
elements or directly from inputs to the system. It multiplies each of
its inputs by a corresponding weight w_1 , w_2 , . . . w_n and adds the
results together to form a weighted sum 2002. It then applies a transfer
function 2003 (which is typically non-linear) to the weighted sum, to
obtain a value Z known as the state of the element. The state Z is then
either passed on to another element along a weighted connection, or
provided as an output signal. Collectively, states are used to represent
information in the short term, while weights represent long-term
information or learning.

Processing elements in a neural network can be grouped into three
categories: input processing elements (those which receive input data
values); output processing elements (those which produce output values);
and hidden processing elements (all others). The purpose of hidden
processing elements is to allow the neural network to build intermediate
representations that combine input data in ways that help the model
learn the desired mapping with greater accuracy. Referring now to FIG.
21, there is shown a diagram illustrating the concept of hidden
processing elements. Inputs 2101 are supplied to a layer of input
processing elements 2102. The outputs of the input elements are passed
to a layer of hidden elements 2103. Typically there are several such
layers of hidden elements. Eventually, hidden elements pass outputs to a
layer of output elements 2104, and the output elements produce output
values 2105.

Neural networks learn from examples by modifying their weights. The
"training" process, the general techniques of which are well known in
the art, involves the following steps:

1) Repeatedly presenting examples of a particular input/output task to
the neural network model;

2) Comparing the model output and desired output to measure error; and

3) Modifying model weights to reduce the error.

This set of steps is repeated until further iteration fails to decrease
the error. Then, the network is said to be "trained." Once training is
completed, the network can predict outcomes for new data inputs.

In the present invention, data used to train models 908 are drawn from
various database files containing data on individual properties. These
data are aggregated to obtain medians and variances across geographic
areas. Thus, models 908 are able to capture relationships among
individual property characteristics, as well as relationships between
individual property characteristics and the characteristics of the
surrounding geographic area.

Referring now to FIG. 19, there is shown an example of this technique.
House 1901 has associated with it individual property characteristics
1902, namely 2500 square feet, 3 bedrooms, and a 6000 square foot lot.
In order to provide effective predictive modeling of the estimated
selling price of house 1901, neural network models 908 use area
characteristics 1904 for geographic area 1903. The area characteristics
1904 are 2246.4 average square feet, 2.5 average bedrooms, 7267.2
average square foot lot size, and $267,000 average selling price. These
represent averages for homes sold in area 1903 in the last x months,
where x is a predetermined time period. By comparing individual property
characteristics 1902 with area characteristics 1904, neural network
models 908 are able to more effectively estimate the selling price of
house 1901.

An important factor in the effectiveness of neural network models 908 is
the sample size used to train models 908. Conventional regression models
and model designs for real estate appraisal generally use small samples
in an attempt to provide a homogeneous group of properties in the
developmental sample. See J. Mark & M. Goldberg, "Multiple Regression
Analysis and Mass Assessment: A Review of the Issues", The Appraisal
Journal v. 56(1)., pp. 89-109 (1988), and H.-B. Kang & A. Reichert, "An
Empirical Analysis of Hedonic Regression and Grid-Adjustment Techniques
in Real Estate Appraisal", AREUEA Journal v. 19, no. 1, pp. 70-91
(1991), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. For
example, properties within a single city block would generally provide
effective predictor models for capturing neighborhood characteristics
within the block. A problem with this approach is that a large number of
distinct models must be built. Since each model is created using a set
of training data describing properties within the associated city block,
an extremely large number of properties is required to effectively train
all the models.

On the other hand, use of larger geographic areas such as ZIP codes
results in diminished ability to capture local neighborhood characteristics.

The method of the present invention provides effective predictor
variables that preserve information describing neighborhood
characteristics without unduly increasing the number of models and
predictor variables required for training. It accomplishes this by
aggregating individual property data in the training data set into area
characteristics in a flexible manner, using the smallest geographic
areas containing sufficient data to produce reliable models 908. The
models 908 are thus able to capture area characteristics for relatively
small geographic areas where the data describing these characteristics
are available.

Referring now to FIG. 17, there is shown an example of geographic
subdivision according to the present invention. Each region 1701 is
divided into successively smaller geographic areas. In the example
shown, the geographic areas are ZIP codes 1702, census tracts 1703, map
coordinates 1704, and assessor parcel number (APN) groups 1705. Other
geographic areas, such as census blocks, or lot blocks, may also be used.

Referring now also to FIG. 18, there is shown a flowchart of the
aggregation method. System 100 uses data describing real estate sales
activity for each month of a user-specified training period, such as
eighteen months. For each month within the training period, system 100
performs the steps shown in FIG. 18. System 100 initially defines 1804
the "neighborhood" as the smallest geographical area, such as the APN
group 1705. If there have been any sales in the previous 12 months 1805,
system 100 proceeds to step 1813. If not, it defines 1806 the
neighborhood as the next larger geographic area, the map code 1704. If
there have been at least 3 sales in the previous 12 months 1807, system
100 proceeds to step 1813. System 100 continues to enlarge the
definition of the neighborhood until a predetermined minimum number of
sales have occurred within a predetermined period of time. The minimum
number of sales and the period of time in steps 1805, 1807, 1809, and
1811 may vary according to the optimal sample size and geographic
specificity required. In addition, the number and size of the geographic
areas may vary. Once the predetermined minimum number of sales for a
particular geographic area has been met, system 100 determines 1813
medians, averages, and variances for various property characteristics
such as sales price, square feet, number of bedrooms, etc.

Once system 100 has obtained predictor variables as described above for
each month in the training period, the predictor variables are fed to
networks 908 and networks 908 are trained. The embodiment illustrated
herein uses a modeling technique known as a backpropagation neural
network 908. This type of network 908 estimates parameters which define
relationships among variables using a training method. The preferred
training method, well known to those skilled in the art, is called
"backpropagation gradient descent optimization" and is described in
Gopinathan et al., although other well-known neural network training
techniques may also be used.

Once the neural networks have been trained using training data, the
network model definitions are stored in data files in a conventional
manner. These data files describe the neural network architecture,
weights, the data configuration, data dictionary, and file format.

In addition to developing and storing neural network models 908 as
described above, model development component 901 also develops error
models 909. Typically, these error models 909 are implemented as
conventional regression models, known to those skilled in the art,
although other predictive modeling-techniques, such as neural networks,
may be used. As with neural network models 908, different error models
909 may be provided for different regions.

To develop error models 909, system 100 determines the absolute percent
error of the neural network model estimate for each record in the
training data set. Based on a set of input parameters, error model 909
is trained to forecast the absolute percent error of the neural network
model estimate. Training methods for regression models are well known in
the art. An example of a set of input parameters used in the embodiment
illustrated herein is given below:

Property Valuation Component 902

As seen in FIG. 9, property valuation component 902 reads data 905
describing the property to be appraised (known as subject property) and
data 906 describing the surrounding geographical area 906, and generates
as output 907 a price estimate for the subject property. Furthermore,
property valuation component 902 outputs a range of values based on the
estimated maximum error of the price estimate, as well as a list of
contributing variables, or reason codes, for the price estimate.

Property data 905 are generally entered by the user on a data entry form
such as those shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. The data may be entered either
interactively, or in batch mode using tape or disk storage devices.
Property data 905 describe the particular property to be appraised, and
they typically include the same types of predictor variables as listed
above for training data 904.

Area data 906 are collected from databases describing properties in
geographical areas surrounding the subject property. The method by which
area data 906 are collected is described below. Typically, area data 906
include averages of the same types of predictor variables as listed
above for training data 904.

Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown a flowchart of the property
valuation process of the present invention. System 100 obtains 1001
property data 905 from user input or batch input. Based on property data
905, it determines 1001 the appropriate region to be used for the
analysis. As shown in FIG. 17, a region 1701 is a relatively large
geographic area containing a number of smaller geographic areas. Each
region 1701 may be associated with a separate neural network model 908,
as well as a separate error model 909. System 100 then loads 1003 neural
network model 908 and error model 909 for the region 1701 containing the
subject property.

System 100 then determines 1005 which area to use in the analysis and
obtains area data 906. In determining 1005 the optimal area for the
analysis, system 100 uses a technique that captures local neighborhood
characteristics while including a sufficiently large sample size to
preserve predictability and reliability. Generally, system 100
accomplishes this by seeking the smallest geographic area containing
both the subject property and at least one other property that was sold
within the past x months, where x is a predetermined time period.

Referring now also to FIG. 11, there is shown the method of determining
1005 the optimal area to use. As shown in the flowchart, system 100 uses
the smallest geographic area containing at least one property that was
sold within the past x months, in addition to the subject property. The
minimum number of properties, the time period, and the particular areas
available for use, may vary depending on the level of geographic
specificity and sample size desired.

System 100 applies 1006 the appropriate neural network 908 to subject
property data 905 and area data 906. Neural network 908 generates
estimated value 1007. System 100 then determines 1008 reason codes
indicating which inputs to model 908 are most important in determining
estimated value 1007. Any technique to generate such reason codes may be
used. In the embodiment illustrated herein, the technique set forth in
co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 07/814,179, for "Neural Network
Having Expert System Functionality", by Curt A. Levey, filed Dec. 30,
1991, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, is
used. System 100 uses the reason codes to generate 1009 a list of
contribution factors to the estimated value, shown in FIG. 5 as positive
contribution factors 505 and negative contribution factors 506.

System 100 also estimates 1010 the error range of its appraisal. In the
embodiment illustrated herein, error estimation is performed by applying
error model 909, typically a regression model, to subject property data
905 and area data 906. Error model 909 uses conventional regression
techniques to generate an absolute percent error estimate E. System 100
generates a lower bound and an upper bound for the error range by
applying the following formulas:

Lower bound=P/(1+E)                                        (Eq. 1)

Upper bound=P/(1-E)                                        (Eq. 2)

where P is the estimated property value and E is the absolute percent
error estimate.

Alternatively, system 100 may estimate the error range using a technique
known in the art as robust backpropagation, as described in H. White,
"Supervised Learning as Stochastic Approximation", International Joint
Conference on Neural Networks, San Diego, Calif. (1990), the teachings
of which are incorporated herein by reference.

When robust backpropagation is used, system 100 does not require error
model 909. Rather, two additional secondary neural network models 908
are used. Each of the two secondary models 908 is trained to estimate a
specified percentile of the conditional distribution of sales prices.
For example, the first secondary model 908 may be trained to estimate
the 10th percentile of the conditional distribution, while the second
secondary model 908 estimates the 90th percentile. These models 908 are
trained and implemented in the same technique and using the same
predictor values as described above for neural network model 908. When
estimating a sales price for a subject property, the property data is
sent to secondary models 908 in addition to primary neural network model
908. Secondary models 908 produce lower and upper bounds L and U for the
error range.

Whichever technique is used to generate the lower and upper bounds L and
U, system 100 then outputs 1011 the estimated property value, as well as
the range defined by L and U designated in FIG. 5 as a lowest typical
sales price 503 and a highest typical sales price 504.

Finally, system 100 generates 1012 reports as appropriate and as
requested by the user. A typical report is statistical review report 701
shown in FIG. 7.

Referring now to FIG. 12, there is shown a method of generating 1012
reports according to the present invention. System 100 analyzes 1202
market trends as shown in FIG. 13. It first determines 1302 and 1303
county and ZIP code sales price trends over the past 24 months. Then it
determines 1304 local sales price trends by census tract, map code, and
APN group over the past 24 months. It classifies 1305 trends as stable,
moderate upward or downward trend, or steep upward or downward trend.
The trends and their classifications are used in generating regional
trend analysis portion 704 and local trend analysis portion 705 of
statistical review report 701 shown in FIG. 7. If alternative
geographical subdivisions are used, the above-described method of market
trend analysis is altered accordingly.

System 100 then determines 1203 the degree of conformity of the subject
property with regard to the neighborhood. This is done according to the
method shown in FIG. 14. System 100 determines the median and variance
of neighborhood sales prices 1402, square footages 1403, and prices per
square footage 1404. Medians and variances for other variables may be
collected as well, if desired. The distribution within the neighborhood
is used in generating subject conformity portion 706 of statistical
review report 701. System 100 determines 1405 whether the property
deviates by more than one standard deviation from the neighborhood norm.
If not, system 100 classifies 1406 the property as conforming. If the
property deviates by more than one standard deviation, system 100
determines 1407 if the property deviates by more than two standard
deviations. If not, system 100 classifies 1408 the property as
non-conforming. If the property deviates by more than two standard
deviations, system 100 classifies 1409 the property as extremely
non-conforming. Additional levels of conformity classification may be
provided. System 100 uses the conformity classification in generating
summary and recommendations portion 708 of statistical review report 701.

System 100 generates 1204 subject valuation portion 707 based on the
estimated value determined by neural network 108.

System 100 generates 1205 summary and recommendations portion 708 using
the method shown in FIGS. 15 and 16. Referring now to FIG. 15, there is
shown the method of comparing an estimated property value to
user-specified values. System 100 determines 1502 whether the appraised
value as determined by a human appraiser falls within the valuation
range generated by neural network model 908 and error model 909. If not,
system 100 determines the percent outside the range and outputs 1503
this value in summary and recommendations portion 708. System 100 then
determines 1504 if the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, based on the estimated
value of the property and the amount of the contemplated loan, is within
a user-specified maximum LTV. If not, system 100 determines the percent
above the maximum and outputs 1505 this value in summary and
recommendations portion 708.

Referring now to FIG. 16, there is shown the method of generating
recommendations. System 100 determines 1602 whether the LTV is within
the maximum LTV. If not, it recommends suspension of the loan 1603. If
the LTV is within the maximum LTV, system 100 determines 1604 whether
the property is conforming. If the property is not conforming, system
100 determines 1605 whether the property is extremely non-conforming. If
the property is not extremely non-conforming, system 100 recommends
caution with regard to the contemplated loan 1606. If the property is
extremely non-conforming, system 100 recommends suspension of the loan
1607. If the property is conforming, system 100 determines 1608 whether
the market is declining. If so, it recommends caution 1609. If the
market is not declining, system 100 determines 1610 whether the
appraisal as performed by the human appraiser falls within the range
generated by neural network model 908 and error model 909. If the
appraisal does not fall within the range, system 100 recommends caution
1611. If the appraisal falls within the range, system 100 recommends
that the loan proceed 1612. System 100 outputs its recommendation as
part of summary and recommendation portion 708 of statistical review
report 701.
